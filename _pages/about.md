Hey there! I am a second year master student at the University of Michigan, majoring in Computer Science and Engineering. 

My research interests broadly lie in systems for ML and debugging and testing of software systems. I am fortunate to work with [Prof. Mosharaf Chowdhury](https://www.mosharaf.com/) and [Prof. Baris Kasikci](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~barisk/). I've built debugging tools that help improve the reliability of software systems operating on emerging hardwares.  I am also one of the key contributors of [FedScale](https://github.com/SymbioticLab/FedScale). I am currently building a deployment platform for federated learning. My recent interest focuses on providing a privacy-enhancing solution for federated learning.
